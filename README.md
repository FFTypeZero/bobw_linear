# Robust Best-arm Identification for Linear Bandits

This repo contains code for the paper "A/B Testing and Best-arm Identification for Linear Bandits with Robustness to Non-stationarity"

To run the experiment based on Yahoo!'s dataset, user needs to first download Yahoo! Webscope Dataset R6A from https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=r and then runs file `process_yahoo.py` and  `get_instance_yahoo.py` in order to get `yahoo_data_pca.npz`.
